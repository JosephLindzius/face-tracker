## About

Found this great AI/API from Github user [justadudewhohacks](https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js/) where it is used to detect faces.  This really impressed me but what blew me away was the fact that you can do it all locally on a browser.

    Please note that the way the webcam is set up in this video did not work at first.  Refer to my code if needed.  
### Known Issue

The live webcam works without known bugs

For faceIndex.html seems to have a looping problem where it is not reading all pictures before processing but rather gives back undefined.
